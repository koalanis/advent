# ðŸŽ„ advent of code ðŸŽ„
i like advent of code for two reasons:
- the problems are interesting and well written
- its a great problem set to learn a new programming language

this repo contains my progress in trying to solve different Advent of Code problems in a variety of languages

## ðŸŽ… the santa script
this repo contains a script that helps organize the matrix of solutions for the year & day of a AoC problem and the programming language used to solve said problem. 



## todo
- [x] santa check
    - check to see if a solution matrix folder exists i.e `AoC year` + `language` + `day`
- [ ] santa create
    - given a solution matrix, create the folder to house solution
- [ ] santa data
    - store problem data for a given AoC year and day
- [ ] migrate santa to fish shell
