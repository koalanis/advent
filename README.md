# ðŸŽ„ advent of code ðŸŽ„
i like advent of code for two reasons:
- the problems are interesting and well written
- its a great problem set to learn a new programming language

this repo contains my progress in trying to solve different Advent of Code problems in a variety of languages

## ðŸŽ… the santa script
this repo contains a script that helps organize the matrix of solutions for the year & day of a AoC problem and the programming language used to solve said problem.
